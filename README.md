# Two Levels, One Screen
A first attempt at creating a single-screen platformer in pygame. Assets from Kenney's [Pixel Platformer 0 asset pack](https://opengameart.org/content/pixel-platformer-0) (Kenney.nl). Most logic from  [Creating a platformer in Pygame with a camera, collisions, animation states and particle effects]((https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWN8GcmJ-jA)). Made in just over two hours.
